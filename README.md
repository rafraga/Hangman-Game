This is the Hangman Game, a little game in javascript/bootstrap/jquery.

In order to play it, just type letters trying to guess the guitar model.

This project is part of the homework given at the UCLA Coding Bootcamp program (2018), class UCLAWES201802FSF3, and it's very useful to learn things such as functions in javascript and jquery, as well as bootstrap for the html part.

Thank you,
